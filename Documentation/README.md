This documentation, besides describing all current supported features of the language, is also a development guide to planned features of the Torque language. So the documentation mixes supported features with non-supported ones. In order to help you indentify which features indeed exists, a mark ***(sketch)*** will be used to tag the planned features. Also, to simplify things, many code examples in here will omit the `main` function.

This documentation will not deeply approach well-known concepts like general control-flow instructions, variables, functions, structures, etc. So, this documentation is more recommended for programmers with experience in other languages, like C/C++, C#, Java, Rust, etc. If you're a beginner to programming, you'll probably not understand much from here. A more friendly language tutorial will be created after the language development is more mature.
