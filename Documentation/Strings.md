A text character in Torque is represented by the type `char` and the notation `'char'`.
A string, at least in low level, doesn't have a special type and is represented as an array of characters, `char[]` or `char*`, with the notation `"hello, world"` ***(sketch)***.

Torque also has support for escape sequences, like `\n`.
