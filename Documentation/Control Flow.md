Torque has the already well-known control flow statements `if`/`else`, `while` and `for`.

```
# "{}" can be omitted if the block has only one statement
if (2 == 2)
    doSomething();
else
    doAnotherThing();
```

```
while (true)
    forever();
```

```
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    count(i);
```
